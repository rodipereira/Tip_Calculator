# Tip Calculator
This Python program helps calculate the amount each person should pay after adding a tip to the bill. 
It prompts the user to enter the total bill amount, the desired tip percentage, and the number of people splitting the bill. 
The program calculates the total amount with the tip included and then divides it by the number of people, giving each person's share rounded to two decimal places.
